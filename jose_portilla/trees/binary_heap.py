# A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
# 1) Itâ€™s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.
#
# 2) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.


# Complete Binary Tree --> Each level has all nodes
# priority queues are queues where element of highest priority is at the beginning of the queue. Basically all elements are arranged by priority
# Its implemented using Binary Heap:
# Below formula applies if 0th element is defaulted to 0
# index of right side element = 2i+1 => i is the current index
# parent node = i//2
# index of left side element = 2i
# root
# /  \
# L   R
